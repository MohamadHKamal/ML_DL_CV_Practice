EOG_Classification is a machine learning project for classifying the signal of the eye, Feature extraction method based on 
digital signal processing techniques such as wavelet.
The Data folder contains:
-- test_down.txt file that contains the down movement signal of the eye.
-- test_up.txt file that contains the up movement signal of the eye.
-- train_up, and train_down for training.
-- Test_Down_Life_Cycle and Test_Up_Life_Cycle are used to check the life cycle of the signal.
-- Demo.mp4 is a video that concludes the project run.
-- You can run the project from the file Deploy.py.
-- DSP_Repor.pdf contains the details of the expiremts.
